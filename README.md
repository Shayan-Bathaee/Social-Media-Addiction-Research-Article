# Social Media Addictions and Repercussions

This repository contains an article I wrote for my techincal writing class at the end of 2021. The article was written in LaTeX using IEEE format, and all of the source code can be found in the `src` directory. To write the article, I conducted research by seeking out recent peer reviewed articles on social media addiction, gathering information, and presenting the results.

The article discusses the following subjects relating to social media addiction: Social media history, defining social media addiction, frequency of social media addiction, mental and physical repercussions of prolonged social media use, and company impact. The goal of this article is to bring awareness to those who use social media frequently.
